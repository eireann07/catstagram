# Catstagram: Simplified Instagram clone

*Simplified Instagram clone for cats built with React, browser based. Deployed [here](https://catstagram-navy.vercel.app/) with Vercel hosting. Users can copy and paste URLs of cat images to display on the site and can "like" images and see like counts underneath each image.*

**What I enjoyed about building this app:** I REALLY like React! The components feel intuitive and logical, and I love the functionality of JSX in building functionality and content in the component -- to clearly see the functionality and content in one place is really helpful for me to conceptualize. 

**What I struggled with when building this app:** Some of the styling elements. This was the first time I was only given a mock-up to recreate, so it was more difficult than I anticipated to correctly style the elements to match the mock-up. Additionally, understanding props and targetting events was difficult to wrap my head around at first, but once I understood it, it felt pretty intuitive. 

**What I learned from building this app:** SO MUCH! Components, props, Babel, JSX...the list goes on. Definitely the most educational practice with writing code that I've experience thus far. I really like both the logic and challenge of React. Looking forward to using it more!
